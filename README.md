## Keeping your fork synced with this repository

Now I'll be merging all your changes into the master branch of this project. Your fork won't have those changes. In order to keep your fork synced with mine, add my repo's url as `upstream remote url`.
```
git remote add upstream https://github.com/Roshanjossey/first-contributions
```
This is a way of telling git that another version of this project exists in the specified url and we're calling it master. Once the changes are merged, fetch the new version of my repository.
```
git fetch upstream
```

Here we're fetching all the changes in my fork (upstream remote). Now, you need to merge the new revision of my repository into your master branch.
```
git rebase upstream/master
```
Here you're applying all the changes you fetched to master branch. If you push master branch now, your fork will also have the changes
```
git push origin master
```
Notice here you're pushing to the remote named origin.
